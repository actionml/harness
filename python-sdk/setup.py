                       ActionML is a prediction server for building smart
                       applications. While you search data through a database
                       server, you can make prediction through ActionML.
                       With ActionML, you can write apps
                       - that predict user behaviors based on solid data
                         science
                       - using your choice of state-of-the-art machine
                         learning algorithms
                       - without worrying about scalability
                       Detailed documentation is available on our
                       `documentation site <a href="http://actionml.com/docs">docs</a>`.
                       This module provides convenient access of the
                       ActionML API to Python programmers so that they
                       can focus on their application logic.
