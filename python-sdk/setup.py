                       Harness is a machine learning server for building smart
                       applications. Adding Engines for different algorithms
                       (recommenders, classifiers, deep learning/ neural nets, etc.)
                       allows Harness to take input and serve ML type queries
                       for just about any ML algorithm using most any compute engine
                       (Spark, TensorFlow, Mahout, Vowpal Wabbit, etc.)

                       This module provides convenient access of the
                       Harness REST API for Python programmers so that they
