/** Scafolding for a Kappa Algorithm, change with KappaAlgorithm[T] to with LambdaAlgorithm[T] to switch to Lambda,
  * and mixing is allowed since they each just add either real time "input" or batch "train" methods. It is sometimes
  * possible to make use of real time input in a LambdaAlgorithm such as the Universal Recommender making real time
  * changes to item attributes directly in the model rather than waiting for a training task.
  * This is not the minimal Template because many methods are implemented generically in the
  * base classes but is better used as a starting point for new Engines.
