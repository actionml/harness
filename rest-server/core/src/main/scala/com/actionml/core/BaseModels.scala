/* todo: we should come up with a better way of composing or mixing case classes so they can be more
* easily extended in child classes while allowing the child class to parse (json4s) the parent
* case class from JSON. For instance EngineParams might be used by Engine, but some child of
* EngineParams would be used in a chile Engine class.
