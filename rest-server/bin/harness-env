# The maximum number of concurrently accepted connections.
# Note, that this setting limits the number of the connections on a best-effort basis.
# It does *not* strictly guarantee that the number of established TCP connections will never
# exceed the limit (but it will be approximately correct) because connection termination happens
# asynchronously. It also does *not* guarantee that the number of concurrently active handler
# flow materializations will never exceed the limit for the reason that it is impossible to reliably
# detect when a materialization has ended.

# has to be completed.
# Incoming requests that would cause the pipelining limit to be exceeded
# are not read from the connections socket so as to build up "back-pressure"
# to the client via TCP flow control.
# A setting of 1 disables HTTP pipelining, since only one request per
# connection can be "open" (i.e. being processed by the application) at any
# time. Set to higher values to enable HTTP pipelining.
# This value must be > 0 and <= 1024.
